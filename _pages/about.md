<br>

I have a strong interest in low latency, algorithms, data processing, and real-time rendering.

Experienced in system design and programming, with a focus on performance, code correctness, and readability. I'm also a C++ advocate and deeply interested in this programming language.

I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Castilla-La Mancha.

Currently working for Ericsson R&D in the Packet Core group (Analytics and Optimizations).
